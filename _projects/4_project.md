Completed my Software Engineering Internship (STEP) at Google, Shanghai in July 2023 - September 2023 under NEST team. My internship mainly focused on helping to develop the software end of indoor camera's communication, including building the pipline of sending dataflows and maintaining buffers to the cloud end, and also building the real-time statistics tools of daily data streams.

- Executed real world project development using a very large code base and complicated code logics.
- Integrated six useful features into the Nest Camera product and designed a dashboard which can execute dataflow monitoring.
- Honed understanding of several tools and the code standards in Google efficiently.
- Earned highly positive feedback from hosts about my coding ability and communication skills.
